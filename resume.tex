%%Advisor: Dr. Tingting Chen.
%
%%Research Topics: Expected Transmission Count (ETX) as countermeasure against wormhole attacks; Sensing uncertainty and discretized sensing in crowdsourcing/crowdsensing; Collusion resistance in crowdsourcing.
%%I worked on the wormhole attacks and incentive issues of crowdsourcing.
%%
%%For the research of wormhole attacks, I quantified the negative impacts of wormhole attacks on network coding systems and proposed the Expected Transmission Count (ETX) based algorithms to defend against wormhole attacks for network coding systems. Extensive simulations have verified the validness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
%%
%%For incentive issues of crowdsourcing, I researched two problems:
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item {\it Sensing Uncertainty}: I investigated the negative impacts of uncertainty on crowdsourcing, and proposed the incentive mechanism that can achieve Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibrium for the crowdsourcing game with uncertain perturbations. I also designed extensive simulations to successfully verify the correctness and efficiency of the proposed incentive mechanism.
%%\item {\it Finite Sensing Precisions}: I investigated the harmful influences of finite precisions on crowdsensing, and proposed the incentive mechanism that can achieve Bayesian Nash Equilibrium for the crowdsensing game with finite sensing precisions. Extensive simulations have verified the proposed mechanism is valid and efficient.
%%\end{itemize}
%\item {\bf Teaching Assistant} (08/2012-Present) at Oklahoma State University (OSU).
%%Jobs:
